Mathematica utilities for Stack Exchange
===========

A Safari extension for Safari 7 on Mac OS X that provides [enhanced features](http://meta.mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/1043/additional-useful-buttons-for-our-m-se-editor) for the MarkDown editor at mathematica.stackexchange.com. This helps to convert Mathematica function names like ListPlot into inline code which is linked to the Wolfram documentation. Furthermore, it can replace Mathematica characters like \[Alpha] or \[ForAll] into Unicode. Additionally there is a button to easily create keyboard shortcuts.

(The extension simply packages Halirutan's script, which you can find at [github.com/halirutan/SE-Editor-Buttons](http://github.com/halirutan/SE-Editor-Buttons).)
